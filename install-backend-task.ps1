#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
<#
Registers the "LLM Judge Backend" scheduled task, so the backend on
http://127.0.0.1:8000 starts when Windows boots and keeps running while you are
logged off. run-backend-service.bat restarts it 30 seconds after any crash.

Run once, in PowerShell opened with "Run as administrator", from this folder:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-backend-task.ps1

Windows asks for your account password: a task that runs while you are logged
off needs it (for a Microsoft account, the account password, not the PIN).
Nothing runs while the laptop sleeps, hibernates or is shut down.
Remove the task again with uninstall-backend-task.ps1.
