"""Tells a chatbot's real answer apart from a service message.

Many chatbots answer HTTP 200 even when they did not answer the question: a
daily limit, a login wall, an expired session or an internal error comes back
as ordinary reply text. Scored as an answer, that text drags every metric down
and pollutes the trend, so the connector treats it as an error instead.

Only short replies are checked: a service message is a sentence or two, while
a real answer that happens to mention "rate limit" (an API docs bot, say) is
usually longer.
